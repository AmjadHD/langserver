# Nim Language Server

Nim Language Server, or `nimlangserver`, is a language server for Nim.

## Installation

### Installing binaries

You can install the latest release into `$HOME/.nimble/bin` using e.g.:

```sh
nimble install nimlangserver
```

### From Source

```bash
nimble build
```

## Configuration Options

- `nim.projectMapping` - configure how `nimsuggest` should be started. Here it is
  sample configuration for `VScode`. We don't want `nimlangserver` to start `nimsuggest`
  for each file and this configuration will allow configuring pair
  `projectPath`/`fileRegex` so when one of the regexp in the list matches current file
  then `nimls` will use `root` to start `nimsuggest`.
- `nim.timeout` - the request timeout in ms after which `nimlangserver` will restart the language server. If not specified the default is 2 minutes.
- `nim.nimsuggestPath` - the path to the `nimsuggest`. The default is `"nimsuggest"`.

``` json
{
    "nim.projectMapping": [{
        // open files under tests using one nimsuggest instance started with root = test/all.nim
        "projectPath": "tests/all.nim",
        "fileRegex": "tests/.*\\.nim"
    }, {
        // everything else - use main.nim as root.
        "projectPath": "main.nim",
        "fileRegex": ".*\\.nim"
    }]
}
```

## Features

You can install `nimlangserver` using the instuctions for your text editor below:

### VSCode

### Emacs

- Install [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) and `nim-mode` from melpa and add the following to your
  config:

   Both `nimlangserver` and `nimlsp` are based on `nimsuggest`, but the main
   difference is that `nimlsp` has a single specific version of `nimsuggest`
   embedded in the server executable, while `nimlangserver` launches `nimsuggest`
   as an external process. This allows `nimlangserver` to handle any `nimsuggest`
   crashes more gracefully and enables it to work with multiple versions of Nim
   concurrently.
